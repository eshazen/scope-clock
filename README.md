# Oscilloscope Clock

OK, time to jump on the oscilloscope clock bandwagon!
It's an old idea, but they just look so cool.

The idea here is to make one PCB which includes everything needed
to directly drive many CRTs.  It will be a remix of Jon Stanley's
[Ultra-Simple Oscilloscope](https://www.electronixandmore.com/projects/simplescope/index.html)
(available as a PCB [here](http://www.catahoulatech.com/index.php?product=KIT-0001)
and the 
[Dutchtronix AVR Oscilloscope Clock](http://www.dutchtronix.com/ScopeClockH3-1-Enhanced.htm).

Both seem to be open-source designs which can be used with attribution.
