# 6T9 Sound card

Working on a design with:

* ATTiny84a MCU
* SN76489 PSG
* 6T9 amp inspired by [this design](https://diyaudioprojects.com/Tubes/6T9-Tube-Amp-Kit/).
* Voltage doubler power supply

The output stage is based at about 30mA B+.  Hopefully the voltage doubler and 
extra winding on on the Antek can handle this OK.

Planning to use OT8SE+HF+5K transformer I have lying around from MPS.
It's rated at 45mA DC.

Layout ~ done.  Many parts have DigiKey "TR" option, need to fix this.
